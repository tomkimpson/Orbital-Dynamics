# Spin Curvature Dynamics of a Pulsar in Kerr Spacetime

This code calculates the orbital motion of an astrophysical body, such as a pulsar, on a background Kerr spacetime. Going beyond the point particle approximation, we instead model an extended spinning body via the Mathisson-Papertrou-Dixon equations.


The code solves a set of ODEs numerically. These equations are based on the original works of [Mathisson 1937](http://inspirehep.net/record/48323/citations), [Papetrou 1951](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1951.0200) and [Dixon 1964](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02734579). Consequently these equations are known as the MPD equations.
